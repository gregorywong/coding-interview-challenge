# 100-day Coding Interview Challenge

Hi! We’re Sean and Greg. Join us on the **100-day Coding Interview Challenge**!

In 100 days, we’ll do 100 coding “interviews” - averaging out to 1 per day! One of us will prepare a question and solution in advance, but the other one will see it for the very first time. (Just like in actual coding interviews, where you’re expected to solve a problem after seeing it only once!)

As a developer or engineer, it’s very important to be able to communicate your ideas and reasoning. We undertook this challenge because we want to improve at structuring our thoughts and expressing ourselves. **To motivate ourselves to do well and to hold each other accountable, we’ll stream all 100 of our “interviews” - mistakes and blunders included!**

We hope that this is something you’ll find useful as well. Join us on this adventure and see where it leads!
